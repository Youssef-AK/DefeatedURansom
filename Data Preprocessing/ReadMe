# Data Preprocessing for DefeatedURansom

This repository contains the data preprocessing scripts used in the DefeatedURansom project. The scripts are designed to extract features from report.json files and convert them into a suitable format for image-based detection of ransomware threats.

## Overview
The data preprocessing stage is crucial in any machine learning project. It involves cleaning the data and transforming it into a format that can be easily understood by the machine learning algorithms. 
In the context of DefeatedURansom, this involves the following steps:

### 1.Feature Extraction
The feature extraction process involves parsing the report.json files to identify key characteristics of potential ransomware. This includes behaviors such as file system activity, registry activity, network activity, and more.

### 2.Image Conversion
Once the features have been extracted, they are converted into images using vectorization and OpenCV. This involves representing the features as vectors and then converting these vectors into images. These images can then be used for image-based detection of ransomware.

## Usage
1. Extract report.json files from Cuckoo Sandbox.
2. Run the feature extraction script on the report.json files.
3. Run the image conversion script on the extracted features.
