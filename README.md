# DefeatedURansom
DefeatedURansom is an innovative cybersecurity solution designed to combat the ever-evolving landscape of ransomware threats. It leverages the power of Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Networks (VEA-GANs) for image-based detection, providing a robust and efficient defense mechanism against ransomware attacks.

## Key Features

**Behavior Defense System:** DefeatedURansom employs a behavior-based detection system that monitors system activities to identify any malicious behavior associated with ransomware attacks.

**Image-Based Detection with VEA-GANs:** Our solution utilizes VEA-GANs to analyze and interpret system images, enabling it to detect subtle changes or anomalies that may indicate a ransomware attack.

**Threat Actor Identification:** Beyond just detecting potential threats, DefeatedURansom is also capable of identifying the threat actor or group behind the attack. This feature allows for a more proactive approach in dealing with ransomware threats by understanding their source and modus operandi.
